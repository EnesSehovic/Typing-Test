Script that checks correctness of your spelling in the alloted time (in minutes)

Libraries needed are os, threading and pyautogui

You need to have two .txt files, the original one and one where you enter your text
After the alloted time runs out, the file in focus (presumably your test file) will be closed
Enter the names of your original and test files

Text files need to be in the same folder as your script
